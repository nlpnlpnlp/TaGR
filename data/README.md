## Embeddings

We provide two types of feature representations here, which you can either download directly or retrain depending on your setup:

### GloVe embeddings

For the GloVe embeddings, you can use the 100-dimensional pretrained GloVe vectors as the word embeddings for node texts.

### DeBERTa4TaG embeddings

For DeBERTa4TaG, we provide DeBERTa embeddings trained on TAPE for the Cora dataset. You can load the pretrained version or retrain them yourself based on the TAPE setup.
